## 🧠 Topics Covered

This repository includes problems from core Data Structures and Algorithms, such as:

- Arrays & Strings  
- Hashing (unordered_map, unordered_set)  
- Two Pointers & Sliding Window  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Greedy Algorithms  

---

## 🛠 Language & Tools

- **C++ (C++17 standard)**
- STL extensively used:
  - `vector`, `map`, `unordered_map`
  - `set`, `priority_queue`
  - `algorithm`, `numeric`

C++ is chosen for its:
- High performance
- Fine-grained control over memory
- Strong presence in competitive programming and interviews

---

## ✍️ Coding Style

- Problem statement added as comments at the top of each file
- Clean and modular logic
- Efficient time and space complexity
- STL used where it improves clarity and performance
- No unnecessary macros or obfuscation

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Build strong algorithmic thinking
- Improve problem-solving speed and accuracy
- Prepare for:
  - Software Engineering interviews
  - Competitive programming
  - System-level and performance-critical roles

---

## 🚧 Status

This is an **actively updated repository**.  
New solutions are added daily as part of consistent practice.

---

## ⭐ Final Note

C++ rewards discipline.  
Daily practice turns complexity into instinct.

Happy coding ⚙️💻
